# TillValle Chatbot Updates - Implementation Summary

## Changes Made Based on Feedback

### 1. âœ… Hide Chat Icon on Mobile When Chatbot is Open
**Problem**: On phone layout, the bottom right chat icon was blocking the text box when the chatbot was open.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added CSS rule in `styles.css` to hide floating chatbot button on mobile when sidebar is open
- Updated JavaScript functions `showChatbotSidebar()` and `hideChatbotSidebar()` to properly handle mobile visibility
- Added window resize event listener to maintain proper visibility when screen size changes

**Files Modified**:
- `public/styles.css` - Added mobile-specific CSS rule
- `public/script.js` - Updated chatbot visibility functions

- Muthaiga North Gardens Balozi: KES 400
- Westlands: KES 350
- Karen: KES 450
- Kilimani: KES 300

**Usage Examples**:
- User: "How much to Westlands?" â†’ Bot: "ðŸšš Delivery to Westlands costs KES 350"
- User: "delivery cost" â†’ Bot: Shows popular area pricing list
- User: "nairobi town to muthaiga" â†’ Bot: "ðŸšš Delivery to Muthaiga costs KES 400"

**Files Modified**:

## Technical Implementation Details

### Location Pricing Logic
```javascript
// Example usage in chatbot
if (lowerMessage.includes('delivery') || lowerMessage.includes('cost')) {
  const mentionedLocation = locations.find(location => lowerMessage.includes(location));
  if (mentionedLocation) {
    const price = deliveryPricing[mentionedLocation];
    return `ðŸšš Delivery to ${locationName} costs KES ${price}`;
  }
}
```

### Mobile Chatbot Button Hiding
```css
@media (max-width: 480px) {
  .chatbot-sidebar.open ~ .floating-chatbot-btn {
    display: none !important;
  }
}
```

### Live Chat Detection
```javascript
if (lowerMessage.includes('live chat') || lowerMessage.includes('human') || 
    lowerMessage.includes('agent') || lowerMessage.includes('angela')) {
  return responses.liveChat[Math.floor(Math.random() * responses.liveChat.length)];
}
```
